# My local setup with Nix

This repo hosts my local MacOS config. Nix and home-manager are really nifty tools for managing packages and your home directory. My system is quite standard, so I don't use `nix-darwin`, but that project is really cool if you're so inclined.

## Features

Feel free to fork and modify. Some highlights include:

 - build your own packages (mostly with Go)
 - Git configs with GPG for personal and company use
 - Custom zsh theme with a nice little `kubectx` snippet
 - ideas on how to split package files by purpose
 - `krewfile` support to install `kubectl` plugins with Nix easily
